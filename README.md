<h1>Data management tool for Miller's Farms.</h1>
<h3>TYPE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO HERE SO WE DONT DO THE SAME THINGS</h3>
<h4>There's an html file named "view_template.html" that has the head, header, and footer for starting out.
You can copy/paste/rename it into the folders you're working on.</h4>

David: I'll do the hive drop page

Connor: I'll make a body page for the yard data

Oscar: I'll do the Owner page

Rob: Moved on to security headaches...

IMPORTANT: Oscar: When I pushed, I edited the AppConfig class in the web folder. Take care to have current
versions of files you edit that you didn't create before pushing again.

Chai: I'll do Bee Company page.
